<h2> ⭐ About </h2>

> [!Note]
> This portfolio showcases the games and projects I've built, highlighting my skills I gained during my developing progress. I'm always tinkering and learning new ways to push the boundaries within the Unity engine.
> 
> I mainly targeting the techniques and skills for multiple genre of games. So that my projects are not about the amount, they are about the qualification and scale.
>
> I like to handle "tough row and hoe" genres such as <b>Action RPG, Open World, Souls-like, Sandbox, RTS, etc </b> and also <b> Unity Editor tools </b>
>
> One more thing, I am a developer, not a designer or an artist, so the UX/UI of those games and tools may cause unexpected discomfort. Anyway, I did my best to make it as good as possible.
> 
> Thank for taking a look on my portfolio, enjoy!

> [!Warning]
> Some of the portfolios are PDF, so you may need to download and open them from local for best experience.
