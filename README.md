<h2> ⭐ About </h2>

> [!Note]
> This portfolio showcases the games and projects I've built, highlighting my skills I gained during my developing progress. I'm always tinkering and learning new ways to push the boundaries within the Unity engine.
> 
> I mainly targeting the techniques and skills for multiple genre of games. So that my projects are diverse of usages and purposes.
>
> I like to handle "tough row and hoe" genres such as <b>Action RPG, Open World, Souls-like, Sandbox, etc </b> and also <b> Unity Editor tools. </b>
>
> One more thing, I am a developer, not a designer or an artist, so the UX/UI of those games and tools may cause unexpected discomfort. Anyway, I did my best to make it as good as possible. If you have a better design, please tell me so I can improve my products.
> 
> Thank for taking a look on my portfolio, enjoy!
